# Task

Create an HTML file (index (main file)), and imagine you are viewing a single blog post web page.

Now visualize that page has:

1. Header, and in header:
  - Logo image
    - When you click a logo it leads to `https://google.com`
  - Button, saying any call to action, ie. 'Contact'
2. Main content area
  - Inside you have a blog post title (heading)
  - Blog post text
    - Few links within the text (wrapped around few words).
  - Blog post image
3. Footer area at the bottom
  - You have a list with 3 items, and each item inside has a link (ie. About, Privacy policy, Contact), linked to whatever.

## Notes

- Drag the file into the browser, to see how it looks. It will look aweful, but that's because HTML it's just marking what content is what, we'll style it in the next lesson. :)
- Try to make it yourself.
- Google HTML elements you need, or refer back to the youtube video or text in this tutorial.
- You'll have an example i made of this above in my own way (you can do it in many ways), in this folder.
