## Task

1. Initiate an npm project.
2. Install express.
3. Create a GET endpoint for root endpoint '/' to return a JSON response { response: 'Ok' }, with 200 status code.
4. Create a GET endpoint for endpoint '/contacts' to return a JSON response with array of objects, each object being a contact (write whatever, name, number, email as properties, hardcode few just as an example), with 200 status code.

## Notes

- My daily job usually is me few times a day (early years all the time) googling for answers for various use cases in code, like above, ie. `how to use express js`, etc.
- Try to make it yourself.
- You'll have an example i made of this above in my own way (you can do it in many ways), in this folder, in folder named `solution`.
