# Task

## Task 1

Continue on with your HTML, CSS task you've done, and apply some updates to it.

1. Get body component and change background-color on it with javascript.
2. Get button component in the header, and add a click event listener (google it), and every time you click that button, console.log 'Clicked!'.

## Task 2

1. Create a function that takes in 2 arguments: string and another string (1 or more characters).
Function should take first argument and remove all characters given as second argument from first string, and return the result

ie. remove('Jooohny Olimp', 'o'); // Returns 'Jhny limp';

2. Create a function that takes in 1 argument a string, reverses that string, and returns the result.

ie. reverse('asd'); // Returns 'dsa';

## Notes

- Type it in a file, then copy it in browser console and see how functions do.
- Test them with various inputs to confirm it's working well.
- If you have no clue what to do, google it, try result you googled, try to then recreate it yourself until you get it. :)
- Try to make it yourself.
- You'll have an example i made of this above in my own way (you can do it in many ways), in this folder.
