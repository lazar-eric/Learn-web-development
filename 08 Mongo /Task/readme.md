# Task

## Task

1. I want you to do the same Task as in Express tutorial, just instead of sending back dummy data for contacts, you actually read / write contacts into Mongo DB, like in example folder.
2. GET /contacts, returns all the contacts in JSON response, with 200 code, from your mongo db.
3. POST /contacts, with contact data in request body, creates a contact in your mongo db.
4. Using postman to test those 2 API endpoints should properly show the results.

## Notes

- My daily job usually is me few times a day (early years all the time) googling for answers for various use cases in code, like above, ie. `how to use express js`, etc.
- Try to make it yourself.
- You'll have an example i made of this above in my own way (you can do it in many ways), in this folder, in folder named `solution`.
