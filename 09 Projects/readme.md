## About

In this folder you'll find mostly full stack project tutotrials. \
Each project has its own folder, with all the technologies in one place, ie. back-end, front-end (react, next.js), etc.

Feel free to use the code in each one for your own commercial, personal needs if you want to, or just for learning purposes to recreate it, have a reference frame for development.
