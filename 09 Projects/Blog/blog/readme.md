# Blog

## About

Blog app in Next.js. As we said in previous tutorials, react is ideal for private apps, like our dashboard for managing posts, etc. But, if we want Google search engine to index our website and blog posts, so they show up in Google search results, we have to make it in Next.js.

We will just make 2 pages: Posts (home page) and Post (single post) page.
