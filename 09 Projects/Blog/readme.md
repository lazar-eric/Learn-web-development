## About

This is a full stack blog app, using:

1. Server - Nodejs, Express
- Validation for POST requests
- Tests

2. Dashboard - React (for managing/creating new blog posts)
- Theming (Dark/light theme)

3. Blog app - Next.js (front-end app for end users to read our blog posts)
- Theming (Dark/light theme)

4. Deployment, we will:
- Upload the code to Github
- Use CircleCI for automatically running tests for our server, every time we push to github / pre deploy
- Deploy our server and apps using free tier in heroku, so we can use the apps online

This is a very simple way of doing things, aimed at beginner web developers. \
That's it, hope it's usefull for you. :)
