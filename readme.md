## About

Hi, I am Lazar, software engineer. Decided to make array of tutorial to teach my friends some software development, and specifically web development.

## Goal

Idea is, and i've been there trust me, to create as simple as possible entrance into this industry, career. There's so much information on learning paths, some very much outdated, some very subjective, but all together overwhelming amount of advices and learning topics for beginners to easily get into this field of work.

I wanna try to cover full stack array of tools, front-end, back-end and startup level devops, as easily as possible, with very few but enough information per tool, so beginners don't get needlessly scared, and can start of their career.

## What's next?

In this repo, you can see each lesson with accompanying folder, with some notes inside, resources + each lesson will be covered by a youtube video i'll make.

After all the lessons, there's a folder named 'Projects', and inside i'll make few projects, and maybe add over time new ones, as template repos for full stack projects, ie. blog, chat app, etc.

## Support

Over time, we'll maybe make a public facebook group, or another app, where all the people that watched this can collab together, i'll be there if you guys get stuck or even once you get a first job and get stuck, to help you out, and so on.

Just relax, follow the tutorials and you'll get to a first job in no time. :)
