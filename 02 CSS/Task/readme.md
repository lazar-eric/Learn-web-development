# Task

Continue on with your HTML task you've done, and apply some styles to it now.

1. First create a style.css files and add it to your HTML file.
2. Add classes, and some ID as you see fit to your HTML elements, for later selection for css.
3. Header:
  - Add a layout (flex).
  - Children should be spaced between them, meaning logo left, and button right, in a same row.
  - Logo should have smaller height, and width should auto adjust.
  - Button, add some styles to it, padding, font-size, background-color, border-radius (rounding of corners).. anything you like.
4. Main content area
  - Add font-family (type of font) to all your heading fonts.
  - Add font-family, a different one to all your paragraph elements.
  - Add some font-size, color and text-align (center) for heading element.
  - Add margin-bottom to heading element, so there's some space between heading and paragraph element.
  - Add line-height to paragraph (ie 1.55) so there's more space between the text lines in paragraph.
  - Style all the links (`<a>`) in your page, to be color orange.
  - Image in blog post should be max-width 700px and should be in the middle of the page (margin-left, right: auto).
5. Footer area at the bottom
  - Add padding and background color to the footer, anything you want.
  - Add layout (flex) to footer, and center if horizontally and vertically.
  - Add layout (flex) style to your list (`<ul>`), so all children (`<li>`) are in a row (flex-direction: row).
  - Add whatever styles to those list items (`<li>`) you want.

## Notes

- Drag the file into the browser, to see how it looks.
- Try to make it yourself.
- Google CSS properties (Styles) you need, or refer back to the youtube video or text in this tutorial.
- You'll have an example i made of this above in my own way (you can do it in many ways), in this folder.
